# 🇰🇭 Khmer Text Sentiment Analysis

An advanced machine learning application for analyzing sentiment in Khmer (Cambodian) text. This project uses TF-IDF vectorization and traditional machine learning models to classify Khmer text into three sentiment categories: Positive, Neutral, and Negative.

## 🌟 Features

- **Khmer Language Support**: Specialized preprocessing for Khmer text
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant sentiment analysis through an intuitive interface
- **Confidence Scores**: Detailed probability breakdown for all sentiment classes
- **Slang Handling**: Recognizes and processes common Khmer slang and phrases
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and responsive Gradio-based UI

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Text Input**: Enter Khmer text in the input box
2. **Preprocessing**: Text is cleaned and normalized for Khmer language
3. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization converts text to numerical features
4. **Prediction**: Machine learning model classifies the sentiment
5. **Results**: View sentiment label with confidence scores for all classes

## 📊 Model Information

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression / Random Forest (best performing model)
- **Vectorization**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- **Classes**: Positive, Neutral, Negative
- **Training Data**: Khmer sentiment analysis dataset

## 🚀 Usage

Simply enter your Khmer text in the input box and click "Analyze Sentiment" to get instant results.

### Example Texts:

**Positive:**

```
ល្អណាស់! វាពិតជាអស្ចារ្យ
(Very good! It's amazing)
```

**Negative:**

```
គួរឱ្យខកចិត្ត មិនល្អទេ
(Disappointing, not good)
```

**Neutral:**

```
ធម្មតាៗ មិនអីទេ
(Normal, it's okay)
```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and preprocessing
- **Gradio**: Interactive web interface
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Deployment platform

## 🎓 Academic Context

This project was developed as part of academic research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages, specifically focusing on Khmer sentiment analysis.

### Key Challenges Addressed:

- **Limited Resources**: Khmer is a low-resource language with limited NLP tools
- **Complex Script**: Khmer script requires special preprocessing techniques
- **Slang and Informal Text**: Model handles colloquial expressions
- **Multi-class Classification**: Distinguishes between three sentiment categories

## 📈 Performance

The model has been evaluated on various metrics including:

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- ROC-AUC scores
- Confusion Matrix analysis

For detailed performance metrics, see the documentation in the repository.
